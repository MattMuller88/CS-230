Work from CS230 - Operating Platforms

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room sought to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. The game would render images from a library of stock drawings at a steady rate until the image is fully rendered or guessed by one of the teams. The client requested a number of software requirements be met, including: A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved, Each team will have multiple players assigned to it, Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name, and Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

One part of this documentation that I believe I did well was the recommendations section. I believe that I was thorough in addressing each of the characteristics and techniques specific to the system architecture.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Writing the executive summary and design constraints for the project helped to give me a specific idea of exactly what The Gaming Room is trying to get out of this game. Having a deep understanding of the vision of the product and the software requirements it has helps to develop more effective code.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could choose one part of this document to revise it would be the evaluations of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating platform. I would make improvements to my evaluations on the client side and I would try to more specifically answer the questions in the project 2 requirements.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

When implementing the user's needs into a software's design, it is important to strive to provide as close to the exact end experience that the user desires as possible. It is so important to consider the user’s needs when designing because they are the one who will ultimately be using the product so if they are not satisfied, then the product has failed.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

My aproach to designing software was to focus on achieving the requirements that The Gaming Room provided for the game. This way, I ensure that it functions exactly as it is supposed to.
